! There are multiple user_nl_cism files in your case directory:
!
! - user_nl_cism is for:
!   - settings that appear in cism_in; these are settings used by the
!     CISM-wrapper layer (the layer sitting between the main CISM code
!     and the rest of CESM), which apply to all ice sheets
!   - settings that appear in the ice sheet-specific cism.config files,
!     for which you want to make the same change for all ice sheets
!
! - user_nl_cism_icesheet (e.g., user_nl_cism_ais, user_nl_cism_gris)
!   is for settings that appear in the ice sheet-specific cism.config
!   files, for which you want to make a change for just one ice sheet
!   (if you set the same variable in both user_nl_cism and
!   user_nl_cism_icesheet, the latter will be used for the given ice
!   sheet)
!
! Users should add all user specific namelist changes below using the
! following syntax:
!
!   namelist_var = new_namelist_value
!
! In user_nl_cism, there is no distinction between variables that will
! appear in cism_in and those that will appear in the cism.config files:
! simply add a new variable setting here, and it will be added to the
! appropriate place in cism_in or the cism.config files.
