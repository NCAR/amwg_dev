## Introduction

## General Code of Conduct

Our code of conduct policy for community members emphasizes the following key principles:

- Be considerate of fellow community members by respecting their time and ensuring that your posts are clear, concise, and thoughtfully crafted.
- Every opinion has value. Respect everyone's opinion and listen attentively to every point of view.
- Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is not an excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. Do not insult or belittle other community members. A comfortable and safe environment is essential for productivity.
