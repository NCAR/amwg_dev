## Code of Conduct (IN CONSTRUCTION)

## Introduction

The **amwg_dev Github** is committed to fostering a respectful and inclusive community for all participants. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for behavior and principles that help create a positive and respectful atmosphere.

We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. This applies equally to all community members, regardless of their title, seniority, background, gender, etc., across all our communication channels, including GitHub project space, emails, and in-person events.

Code of conduct violations diminish the value of our community, and we take them seriously. Please use the form below to report violations. 

## General Code of Conduct

Our code of conduct policy for community members emphasizes the following key principles:

- Be considerate of fellow community members by respecting their time and ensuring that your posts are clear, concise, and thoughtfully crafted.
- Every opinion has value. Respect everyone's opinion and listen attentively to every point of view.
- Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is not an excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. Do not insult or belittle other community members. A comfortable and safe environment is essential for productivity.

## Reporting Violations

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please **report** it promptly using our [reporting form](https://forms.gle/LUN27DkBciReS78x9). The online form offers the option to keep your report anonymous or request follow-up.

## Enforcement and Consequences

As part of the code of conduct policy, we reserve the right to **edit or delete posts** that violate our code. Code of conduct violations may result in reminders, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans.

## Review

This code of conduct document will be reviewed periodically by our core team to ensure its continued relevance.
